        <p>
            I have worked for Prudential Insurance Company since July 2019. I started as a Associate System Developer where I was tasked to help the Embed Intelligence and Machine Learning team as a Scrum Master. Within this team I helped with generating a embed Intelligence engine, via the use of Python. In July of 2020 I was promoted to Analyst System Developer, where I now work as a part time developer as well as helping 4 teams with Scrum Master duties. My teams currently are one of the Enterprise DevOps teams that helped reshape the DevOps space within Prudential.

            I work closely with 4 Product Owners, and other product owners in the company with bringing on new teams to the Enterprise DevOps standard. I helped with creating a new Metrics view, on Splunk to have a holistic view for all CI/CD pipelines provisioned net new with the Enterprise DevOps standard. My daily dask also involved holding numerious stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Backlog grooming meetings, and CI/CD Pipeline Onboarding through Jenkins and AWS CodePipeline. 

            Education: Graduated with a Bachelors in Economics and Mathematics in 2012 , and further continued my education in 2019 with completing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University in 2019. Currently I am pursuing a Masters in Computer Science and a Masters in Artifical Inteligence from Steven's Instutite of Technology, as well as attending a Full Stack Bootcamp with Rutgers University.
