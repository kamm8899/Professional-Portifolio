            I have worked for Prudential Insurance Company since July 2019. I started as a Associate System Developer where I was tasked to help the Embed Intelligence and Machine Learning team as a Scrum Master. Within this team I helped with generating a embed Intelligence engine, via the use of Python. In July of 2020 I was promoted to Analyst System Developer, where I now work as a part time developer as well as helping 4 teams with Scrum Master duties. My teams currently are one of the Enterprise DevOps teams that helped reshape the DevOps space within Prudential. <br/>

My daily dask also involved holding numerious stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Backlog grooming meetings, and CI/CD Pipeline Onboarding through Jenkins and AWS CodePipeline.
