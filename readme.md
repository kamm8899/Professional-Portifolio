## Profesional Portifolio page for Jessica Kamman

# This Repository
This Respository("Professional Portifolio") was started from scratch, it utilizes flexbox for all sections, and it has resizing capabilities from 1024px to 300px. The repo includes various media queries in order to complete this. The current version of the portifolio includes 3 links to Ghithub projects, and the other 2 are placeholders for projects in the future. The available projects will link to the Ghithub project where the code lives. 

Creating this portifolio has taught alot of things, including manipulating the code to get the best resizing quality. The use of flexbox, and current way to use div tags. 

During the course of the creation, I ran into a few troubles, with my div tags, not behaving like I expected, and going through these struggles, has made me more comfortable with the Developer Tools, and debugging strategies.
